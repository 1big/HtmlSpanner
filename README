HtmlSpanner is a more powerful version of Android's Html.fromHtml()

It allows full control over how specific tags are handled and handles <pre> tags and tables out of the box.

HtmlSpanner was originally written as the HTML rendering engine for PageTurner, but was split off under a more
permissive license (Apache 2) so it may be used in commercial projects.

Let me know if it's useful to you :)
